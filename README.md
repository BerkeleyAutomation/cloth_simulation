# cloth_simulation
This repository contains scripts used to simulate cloth physics in 3D under various conditions and interactiosn.

## Files, Scripts, and Directories:

### cloth.py
Contains util functions and core classes for simulating cloth. It can be run immediately to view a quick example, and key parameters can be toggled to adjust properties.

#### To run:

To run an trial that cuts a predefined trajectory on a cloth object, run "python cloth.py" in the terminal.
To run a trial that takes in the physical mouse's location on the canvas as the location of the scissors, run "python cloth.py manual" in the terminal.
